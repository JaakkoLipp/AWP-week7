3. Secret route

Now that we have a session cookie that we can use for authentication, let's create a route that can be used only if the user has logged in. Create a GET route "/api/secret". This route can only be accessed if the token is valid. If the authentication is valid, the server should respond with a status code 200. and if the user is not authenticated, the server should respond with a status 401.
4. Login redirection

If the user is already logged in, no login or registration requests from that client should be handled. Make the POST routes "/api/user/register" and "/api/user/login" redirect the user to somewhere else (for example just "/") if the user tried to access those routes while logged in.
5. Todos

Authenticated user should be able to create a todo list, and add items to existing list. Make POST route to "/api/todos". A user can send todos as a JSON object (example below). The todos of a user should be saved to an array in an object with an id of the user and a list of todos sent by the user. If a user sending the todos is authenticated, the server should respond with the user's todo object, and if not, the server should respond with a 401 status code.

Also, create a GET route to "/api/todos/list, which responds with a list that contains all the todo objects saved to the server.
